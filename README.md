# Generative dialogue system

This work has several models:
1. Eliza - classical pattern matching implementation of chatbot for Russian with language adaptation.
2. Seq2seq - model of sequence to sequence type trained on two different datasets: dialogue and subtitles.
3. Rut5 - Russian text to text generation model
4. RuGPT3 - Russian generation model based on GPT3
5. Evaluation model - DeepPavlov - model used for generated samples representation for cosine distance calculation. Cosine distance between two sentances (original and generated) reflects similarity of these sentences.

Most of models contain .py and .ipynb files. File .ipynb reflects obtained result in output cells.
